### What I Learned

It's been three years since I last worked with HTML and CSS. Through this challenge, I reviewed semantic tags and CSS units like `em`, `vh`, and `px`. Iâ€™m still not confident whether I used them appropriately, so I plan to improve this part through more practice and feedback.

Here's a small snippet I'm proud of:

```css
.container {
  background-color: white;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: 1rem;
  max-width: 320px;
  text-align: center;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
